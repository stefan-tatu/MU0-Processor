# MU0 Processor in Verilog

Welcome to the MU0 Processor repository! This project features a Verilog implementation of the MU0 microprocessor. MU0 is a simple educational processor designed for understanding basic processor architecture and operation.

## Features

- **Basic Processor Architecture**: Implementation of the MU0 processor with a simple instruction set.
- **Instruction Set**: Supports basic operations such as load, store, add, subtract, and jump instructions.
- **Memory and Register Management**: Includes a small memory and a set of registers for processing.
